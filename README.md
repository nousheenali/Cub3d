# Cub3d
3D game using minilibx library

The calculations used in the program are based on the [permadi's raycasting tutorial](https://permadi.com/1996/05/ray-casting-tutorial-table-of-contents/).


To start raycasting we will need 3 information regarding the user.
 * the player’s X coordinate
 * the player’s Y coordinate
 * the angle that the player is facing to.
